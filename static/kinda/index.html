<p>ok so its technically not hidden since it still shows up in history butttt if you clicked on it, it would look like a normal google page just with a different url. BUTTTTTTT if you whoever was looking through your history removed the /hidden part of the url (probably because they got suspicious that it wasnt google.com and they were signed out) they would find the main page and you'd get caught</p>
