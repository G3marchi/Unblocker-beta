        <p>ok the difference between this page and the normal one is that the url stays the same when even when you change pages. this means:</p>
        <p>1. if someone was looking through your history they'd see only 1 website instead of a ton like with the normal site</p>
        <p>2. if they did get suspicious because of the url not being google.com and clicked on it, theyd see normal google (but logged out and under a different url)</p>
        <p>3. the title of the tab in chrome and in history can stay as "google" instead of changing with the site you go to</p>
        <p>the only flaw with this is that if whoever was looking through your history removed the /hidden part of the url they'd find the main page and you'd get caught (dont you dare say i made this just say you found it somewhere on the google but forgot where</p>
        <p><br>also cisco umbrella blocked opening pages in about:blank so i cant do that</p>
