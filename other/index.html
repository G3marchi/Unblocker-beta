        <p><br>1. Some websites might not load <br><br>
        If a website doesnt load or gives a weird error, right click on the link you clicked to get to it, hit copy link address, and paste that in your normal searchbar.<br>
        if that doesnt work then whoever made the website disabled stuff like this so sorry theres nothing i can do about it</p><br>
        <p>
            <br>2. The hiding history thing is kinda jank<br><br>
            Ok the difference between the history hider and the normal one is that the url stays the same, even when you change pages. This means:<br>
            1. If someone was looking through your history they'd see only 1 website instead of a ton like with the normal site<br>
            2. If they got suspicious because of the url not being google.com and clicked on it, theyd see normal google (but logged out and under a different url)<br>
            3. The title of the tab in chrome and in history can stay as "google" instead of changing with the site you go to<br>
            The only flaw with this is that if whoever was looking through your history removed the /hidden part of the url, they'd find the main page and you'd get caught. (Dont you dare say i made this just say you found it somewhere on google but forgot where)

            <br>Ctrl+Tab<br><br>
            Use ctrl+tab or ctrl+shift+tab to move forward or backwards a tab. Less obvious way of changing tabs if a teacher is walking toward you
