            <span id="history"><b>Hiding history</b><br><br></span>
            Ok this is kinda complicated but i wanna brag about it so im gonna. In older versions of this website every time you would change pages when searching, a new tab in history would pop up, and if someone clicked on it, it would bring them to what you were looking at. Now the url stays the same when you change pages, meaning only 1 tab shows up in history, and if someone got suspicious and clicked it, theyd see a blank page named about:blank (you might recognize that from 1. where you go when clicking a broken url, and 2. an old way of hiding your history that got fixed) While this isnt perfect it's absolutely the best history hiding method currently. Something worth mentioning is that you should bookmark this page (g3marchi.github.io) not any is.gd links
        </p>
        <p>
        <b><br>Some websites might not load</b> <br><br>
        If a website doesnt load or gives a weird error, right click on the link you clicked to get to it, hit copy link address, and paste that in your normal searchbar.<br>
        If that doesnt work then whoever made the website your trying to go to disabled stuff like this so sorry theres nothing i can do about it<br><br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Panic Button</b><br><br>
                At any time press escape to replace this tab with aspen<br>
                You could also use <u><a href="/other/#ctrl+tab">ctrl+tab</a></u>, or hit refresh if you absolutely have to
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Who made this</b><br><br>
                kinda annoyed if your asking this question since i didnt want anyone except me to give it out<i>................</i>.................<b>...............</b> anyyywayyss i kinda have to be careful answering since i dont wanna get caught and this is also a public website buttttt ask just about anyone who went to the school with the leopard mascot and theyll probably know<br><br><br>

            Can you trust logging into stuff? Eh I am but it's up to you.<br>
            <u><a href="https://github.dev/g3marchi/g3marchi.github.io"target="_blank">Here</a></u>'s the website code if you really care (no i didnt use a website builder)<br><br><br>

            <u><a href="https://unblockerr-beta.netlify.app/"target="_blank">Here</a></u>'s the beta website. idk why you'd use it but it exists<br>
            Btw clicking any links (except for the searchbar) will bring you out of the beta<br><br><br>

        <p>
            <span id="ctrl+tab"><b>Ctrl+Tab</b><br><br></span>
            Use ctrl+tab or ctrl+shift+tab to move forward or backwards a tab.<br>
            It's just a less obvious way of changing tabs if a teacher is walking toward you<br><br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Why's it kinda slow</b><br><br>
            If your using a chromebook the server is faster than it. If you arent then just get a slower computer or something idfc<br><br><br>
