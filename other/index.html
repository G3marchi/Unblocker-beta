            <span id="history"><b>Hiding history</b><br><br></span>
            Ok this is kinda complicated but i wanna brag about it so im gonna. In older versions of this website every time you would change pages when searching, a new tab in history would pop up, and if someone clicked on it, it would bring them to what you were looking at. Now the url stays the same when you change pages, meaning only 1 tab shows up in history, and if someone got suspicious and clicked it, theyd see a blank page intentionally named "untitled". While this isnt perfect it's absolutely the best history hiding method currently. Something worth mentioning is that you should bookmark this page (g3marchi.github.io) not any is.gd links
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Panic Button</b><br><br>
            At any time press escape to replace this tab with aspen. (Only works on main pages, not when searching or on quick links [shut up ik its kinda useless])<br>
            If your not on the main pages, you could also use ctrl+tab/ctrl+shift+tab to change tabs, or hit refresh if you absolutely have to<br><br>

            <span id="logins"><b>Logging in</b></span><br><br>
            <b>Do not log into school accounts or google.</b> Google logins should be broken anyways, but people get notified if your account is logged into outside of our district (so this websites servers), so don't log into school accounts.<br><br>
