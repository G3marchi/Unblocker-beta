        <b><br>Some websites might not load</b> <br><br>
        If a website doesnt load or gives a weird error, right click on the link you clicked to get to it, hit copy link address, and paste that in your normal searchbar.<br>
        If that doesnt work then whoever made the website your trying to go to disabled stuff like this so sorry theres nothing i can do about it<br><br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="kinda"><b>The hiding history thing is kinda jank</b><br><br></span>
            The difference between the hidden one and the normal one is that the url stays the same when you change pages. This means:<br>
            1. If someone was looking through your history they'd see 1 website instead of a ton<br>
            2. If they got suspicious and clicked on it, theyd see normal google (but logged out and under a different url)<br>
            3. The title of the tab can stay as "google" instead of changing with the site you go to<br><br>
            The only problem is that if they removed the /hidden part of the url, they'd find the main page. 
            (If you get caught dont you dare say i made this just say you found it somewhere on google but forgot where. You'll probably get your computer taken away for a week. (I know from experience))<br>
            <span id="small">cisco umbrella blocked opening pages in about:blank so i cant do that either</span><br><br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Panic Button</b><br><br>
                At any time press escape to replace this tab with aspen<br>
                Because of weird technical reasons this doesn't work when searching or on the history hider.<br>
                Instead use <u><a href="https://g3marchi.github.io/other/#ctrl+tab">ctrl+tab</a></u>, or on the history hider hit refresh to go back to google.
        </p>

            <b>Other /unblockerr's</b><br>(I didn't make these so be careful)<br><br>

            <b>Logging in</b><br><br>
            Can you trust logging into stuff? Eh I am but it's up to you.<br>
            <u><a href="https://github.dev/g3marchi/g3marchi.github.io"target="_blank">Here</a></u>'s the website code if you really care (no i didnt use a website builder)<br><br><br>

            <b>Beta</b><br><br>
            <u><a href="https://unblockerr-beta.netlify.app/"target="_blank">Here</a></u>'s the beta website if this one is broken for some reason or your just curious.<br>
            Btw clicking any links (except for the searchbar) will bring you out of the beta<br><br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id="ctrl+tab"><b>Ctrl+Tab</b><br><br></span>
            Use ctrl+tab or ctrl+shift+tab to move forward or backwards a tab.<br>
            It's just a less obvious way of changing tabs if a teacher is walking toward you<br><br><br>

        <b>Why's it kinda slow</b><br><br>
            If your not using a chromebook (what this was designed for) then yea its gonna feel kinda slow.<br>
            Otherwise, it should be fine since the server is pretty much the exact same speed as a chromebook. If it still feels slow then too bad.<br><br><br>
